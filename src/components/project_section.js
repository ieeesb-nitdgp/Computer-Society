                TGS does a great job of hosting events that instill pride in the
                student body and teach them the history of the college. TGS also
                runs an alumni speaker series that has been hugely successful in
                bringing out students to alumni-sponsored talks, and hearing
                directly from industry leaders who also went to Union. The
                speaker series has been a great engagement piece for the alumni
                to reconnect with current students and share their own Union
                story and how they might learn from that. .

                    A great example of how TGS helped bridge the gap between
                    students and alumni is participating in the college's
                    24-hour fundraising challenge. In 2018 they helped table all
                    day long in the campus center, and engaged directly with
                    their student peers about why they should support the
                    college.

                    The Garnet Society provides great feedback about ideas that
                    College Relations has about engaging new graduates. For our
                    Seniors, I often use them as a sounding board about how to
                    engage them and what they'd like to see when they graduate.
                    I've found they are very candid about what they like, and
                    will certainly let you know if something won't work.{" "}
